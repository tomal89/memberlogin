    ZebraZ Readme file



    * It's not much yet - I'll work on this. Want to help?
      Send suggestions/comments to me at zebraz@ericzander.com

    * To Install:

      1) Unzip the ZebraZ source. Upload the folder (and all
         of it's contents) to your webserver. Be sure to keep the folder name "ZebraZ".
         There are a few (~3) files which rely on this.

      2) IMPORTANT: You MUST change the following files for your own database. Otherwise, it won't work.

            Includes/I_DBConnect.php
            Includes/I_Globals.php


      3) Run the ZebraZ.txt script to create the tables you need for the database.


      4) Run the DummyData.txt script to add some dummy data to get things going.
         There's a lot of places where no data in a table will give errors.

    * I've not tested this but it should work...

    * If you do download and use this, let me know!! Also, let me know of any troubles you
      have, suggestions or offers of help - I'm just beginning this and WANT your help!


    THANKS!
