    ZebraZ Changelog file


Changes since last release:

*  Membership Directory code TOTALLY rewritten. It's actually a lot more
   involved and complex but the previous code was overly simple and had
   some minor bugs in the layout of the address blocks. This new code is
   also a HUGE step towards other forms of reporting out of Members and
   is more flexible for different layouts due to the more modular code.

*  Search function changed to include archived members (previously excluded
   archived members). Need to develop a visual way to differentiate
   archived from acive in the search results. Probably change text color to
   gray.

*  Some minor additions/tweaks to the global vars file (config file). Thanks
   to JoeClark for his input into this.

*  I think that's it.



Planned changes for next release:

*  Further modification to the search function to differentiate archived
   members from non-archived members.

*  Revisit the cron reports - it works but probably only I can work it
   so need to clean it up and develop a GUI for the whole thing (editing
   letters, controling what is run and when, etc... This is the BIG goal
   for next release.

*  Continue to "abstract" everything so as to be club-neutral. (building
   the globals/config file).
